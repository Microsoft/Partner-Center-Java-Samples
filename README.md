# Partner Center Java SDK Samples

![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/partnercenter/sdk/_apis/build/status/partner-center-java-samples-CI)

This console test app provides sample code for all the scenarios supported by the [Partner Center Java SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/Partner-Center-Java). You can also use it for testing.

## Getting Started

Before you build the application, update the values in the *SamplesConfigurations.json* file to reflect the Azure AD authentication information you created in [Partner Center authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/partner-center-authentication).

Under **ScenarioSettings** in the *SamplesConfiguration.json* file, you can set parameters that will be automatically passed into the scenarios that you run.

To modify the list of scenarios that are run, comment out lines in **mainScenarios** or in an individual **Get Scenarios** method found in the *Program.java* file.

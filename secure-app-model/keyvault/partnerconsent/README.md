# Secure App Model

## Partner Consent

This is a sample web application developed in Java that utilizes the [authorization code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-oauth-code) for authentication. Control panel vendors and Cloud Solution Provider partners can leverage this sample to obtain the required consent. Whenever a partner access the web application they will be redirected to Azure AD where they will authenticated using multi-factor authentication (MFA) and provide the required consent. After successfully authenticating and providing consent, the partner will be redirected back to the web application. Finally, the web application will request an access token for use with the Partner Center API. The refresh token returned as part of the token acquisition process will be stored in an instance of Azure Key Vault. This refresh token value is what control panel vendor and Cloud Solution Provider partners will use in their application to request an access to perform operations against the Partner Center API on the partner's behalf.

### Configuration

The required configurations for this sample are found in the [web.xml](src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml). Please update the following values with the corresponding values for your environment.

* **client_id** - The application identifier that represent your application.
* **client_secret** - The secret associated with the application that represents your application.
* **keyvault_url** - The base address for the instance of Azure Key Vault you have deployed (e.g. <https://myvault.vault.azure.net/>).
* **keyvault_cient_id** - The application identifier that you have configured to access the instance of Azure Key Vault.
* **keyvault_client_secret** - The application secret associated with the application configured to access the instance of Azure Key Vault.

Please note that in production scenarios we recommend that you use certificate based authentication to access the instance of Azure Key Vault. The [confidential client flow](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Confidential-client-applications-flows) has been used in the sample for simplicity.
